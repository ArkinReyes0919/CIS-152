    <p>chapter 1: assignment</p>
  <p> I was a kid I always chug in mocha powder because of how delicious they were, but sadly I grew over it because of my addiction for coffee. The moment I realize that there was a matcha coffee I knew in myself that I have try it, and oh boy my hunch was correct. The light sweet, 
    from the coffee, plus the earthly look, because of its green color cause me to fell in love with  it. </p>
